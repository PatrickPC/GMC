                    <p class="animation">Before the establishment of the Gurababa Cooperative all the banking facilities were concentrated to the bazaar areas only and hence villagers especially farmers were not able to grasp saving and credit facilities. They were being cheated by informal money lender by high interest rate. Similarly, villagers used to cultivate only seasonal grains and vegetable for just their consumption purpose. They had no any concept of off seasonal cultivation and business and they were far away from the access to government facilities. Their economic situation was so poor that neither they could nourish the family sufficiently nor provide any better health and education. Taking this pitiable situation into consideration 32 Tharu people of Rawatgaun and Chakhaura village of Dang established the Gurababa Cooperative Organization Ltd on the date June 28, 2013 based on the principle of cooperative under the Nepal cooperative policy 1992 with the aims to motivate its members to develop the regular saving habit from their income to uplift their economic and social status by creating sustainable agricultural development through improved and environment friendly farming practices, agribusiness, saving and credit, and animal husbandry.

                    Initially, Balu Ram Chaudhari (Managing Director) and his assistants Sujata Chaudhary and Debendra Chaudhary worked as volunteers for 3 years. The team started to organise women, men and youth in self-help groups and youth clubs in the village areas by encouraging and motivating the villagers and started saving and credit in one hand and started to lobby and dialogue with government body for subsidy programs and facilities in the other hand. Initially they faced many problems in uniting the villagers and getting concerned from the government bodies but now has been growing smoothly with the broader vision fostering different sectors like saving and credit, agriculture and business, and education and is in close coordination with local, provincial and central government in agricultural programs and activities. Currently, the organization has been working in Dangisharan, Shantinager, and Babai rural municipalities and Tulsipur sub metropolitan. The cooperative is working on the four thematic areas :
                    <li>Economic Development </li>   
                    <li>Member services and capacity development</li>  
                    <li>Institutional Management and Strengthening, and</li> 
                    <li>Leadership development.</li> 
                    <p>The cooperative will initiate further programs for the holistic development of members and community in the future. Gurababa family is in full trust with the highly experienced and dedicated teams of the cooperative that they will implement the designed plans and programs in the future as in the past.</p>
